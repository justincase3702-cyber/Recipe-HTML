        <li>2 tablespoons salted butter</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground paprika</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 2 1/2-quart baking dish.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add macaroni and cook until al dente, about 8 minutes; drain.</li>
        <li>In a large saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Stir in flour and cook for about 1 minute to form a roux. Gradually whisk in milk, and cook, stirring constantly, until the sauce thickens and bubbles. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Stir in cheddar cheese and parmesan cheese until melted and smooth. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Add cooked macaroni to the cheese sauce and stir to combine. Pour the mixture into the prepared baking dish.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, combine bread crumbs, melted butter, and paprika. Sprinkle the bread crumb mixture evenly over the mac and cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the top is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly, about 25-30 minutes. Let it cool for a few minutes before serving.</li>
