<h1>Description:</h1>

`<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 (16 ounce) can refrigerated jumbo buttermilk biscuits</li>

    <li>¼ cup flour</li>
    <li>2 ½ cups milk</li>

</ul>
<h2>Steps:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Arrange biscuits 1 to 2 inches apart on an un-greased cookie sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 13 to 15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, cook sausage in a large skillet over medium heat until thoroughly heated, stirring frequently, about 5 to 6 minutes.</li>
    <li>Stir in flour until well combined.</li>
    <li>Gradually add milk, stirring continuously, until the gravy thickens and comes to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer and stir for 2 more minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
